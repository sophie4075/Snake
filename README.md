# Snake
Keep the snake from colliding with the games borders and itself! Make it grow by eating food and beat the highscore! :)

This is my first larger project and my first video game. I built this game based off of GamesWithGabe's Youtube Snake tutorial and added some little features, such as a highscore, game music and and a pause menu.

Music:
Start/Game Over Menu: 8 Bit Nostalgia - by David Renda via https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/
Pause Menu: Local Forecast â€“ Elevator by Kevin MacLeod
