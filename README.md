# Snake

Welcome to the repository for a Snake Game, a classic arcade game implemented in Java. This project is designed to provide a simple yet entertaining gaming experience, while demonstrating object-oriented design principles.
This is my first larger project and my first video game. I built this game based off of GamesWithGabe's Youtube Snake tutorial and added some little features, such as a highscore, game music and and a pause menu.


## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Guide the snake to eat food and grow in length. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
- **Difficulty Stages:** The game includes multiple difficulty stages that increase the speed of the snake as the player progresses.
- **High Score Tracking:** Scores are tracked between sessions, and the player's high score is displayed on the main menu.
- **Pause and Resume:** Players can pause the game at any moment and resume where they left off.

## Installation

To run this game, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get the game up and running:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sophie4075/snake.git
   
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake
   
3. Compile the Java code:
   ```bash
   javac *.java

4. Run the game;
    ```bash
   java Main
   
## Usage
After starting the game, use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Eat as many pieces of food as possible to increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
