# Snake
Keep the snake from colliding with the games borders and itself! Make it grow by eating food and beat the highscore! :)

This is my first larger project and my first video game. I built this game based off of GamesWithGabe's Youtube Snake tutorial and added some little features, such as a highscore, game music and and a pause menu.


Have a little sneak peak:
